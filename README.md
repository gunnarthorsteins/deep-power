# deep-power

A minimalistic framework for scraping open-source data from Landsnet (Icelandic ISO) about current power and regulation value in the transmission system. It also scrapes weather data from the Icelandic MET.

Am constantly running this on a server as these values are transient and hard to get retrospectively. They must be collected in real-time.
